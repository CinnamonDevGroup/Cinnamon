# Cinnamon

Cinnamon is a discord bot in development, planned to have many features, as well as focus on self-hosting, while also providing a public hosted bot for those who don't want to deal with hosting fees.
Some of its core features will include:
- Golang
- Integrated SQLite to facilitate an easy installation process instead of having to deal with setting up a database manually
- Golang
- Functions powered by schemas, similar to YAGPDB's custom command feature, non-compiled plugins that will form the commands a bot has.
- Placeholder
- ...
- Did I mention Golang?
